# imageManipulator
In this programs, we use the python pillow library to manipulate images. This program can make greyscale images, mirror images and even change the background of images which is knowns as green screening. This project is part of a course which I took in spring 2021 part Stanford CS106A python "code in place 2021". The journey was an enlightening one as I learned a ton of stuff.
